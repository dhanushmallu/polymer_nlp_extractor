### 1. **Material**

**Definition**:
A *material* is any substance or mixture used to make a product or achieve a function. This is the broadest category—encompassing polymers, metals, ceramics, composites, and small molecules.

**Distinctive Features**:

* Can include **polymers** but also **inorganics** (e.g., silica), **biobased materials** (e.g., starch), and **solvents**.
* It is often the object of a study or formulation.

**Examples**:

* Epoxidized Soybean Oil (ESBO)
* L-tartaric acid
* Succinic acid
* Ethyl lactate
* Polyurethane foam
* Carbon fiber

### 2. **Polymer**

**Definition**:
A *polymer* is a subclass of materials made up of repeating monomer units, often long-chain macromolecules. In the chemical domain, this refers primarily to synthetic or bio-based compounds with covalent backbones.

**Differences from Material**:

* All polymers are materials, but not all materials are polymers.
* "Epoxy resin" is a polymer; "toluene" is a material but not a polymer.

**Examples**:

* Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
* Polylactic acid (PLA)
* Epoxidized vegetable oil (EVO)
* Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA)
* Covalent adaptable networks (CANs)

### 3. **Property**

**Definition**:
A *property* is a measurable or descriptive characteristic of a material or polymer. Properties are the targets of evaluation, optimization, or comparison in scientific studies.

**Properties can be**:

* Thermal (e.g., glass transition temperature)
* Mechanical (e.g., storage modulus)
* Rheological (e.g., viscosity)
* Electrical (e.g., dielectric constant)

**Examples**:

* Glass transition temperature (Tg)
* Crosslinking density
* Chemical resistance
* Thermal stability
* Tensile strength
* Swelling ratio

### 4. **Scientific Unit**

**Definition**:
A *unit* is the standard of measurement for a property or value.

**Differences from Symbol**:

* Units measure **magnitude**.
* Symbols label **properties** or **variables** (e.g., σ for stress, E for modulus).
* Units usually follow the value (e.g., 200 °C or 1.1 MPa).

**Examples**:

* °C (degrees Celsius)
* MPa (megapascal)
* mol⁻¹ (inverse mole)
* J/g (joules per gram)
* kJ/mol

---

### 5. **Scientific Symbol**

**Definition**:
A *symbol* is a shorthand or variable used to represent a property, constant, or variable in equations or expressions.

**Differences from Unit**:

* Not a measure, but a representation.
* Often appears in formulas or equations.

**Examples**:

* Tg = glass transition temperature
* σ = stress
* R = gas constant
* E′ = storage modulus
* α = conversion rate

---

### 6. **Value**

**Definition**:
A *value* is the numerical expression of a property, often paired with a unit and/or symbol.

**Examples**:

* 150
* -17
* 88 kJ/mol
* 1.6 MPa
* 0.72 g/mL
